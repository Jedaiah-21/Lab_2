<p><font face="Arial" Color="White" size="6">Pork sisig is a popular Filipino dish. It can be considered as a main dish or an appetizer. The composition of this dish is mainly of pig’s parts such as minced pork meat, ears, and face. Chicken liver, onions, and chili peppers are also added.
</br></br>Sisig originated from Pampanga. This place is considered as the culinary capital of the Philippines. It was invented by Lucia Cunanan. She is popularly known as Aling Lucing and the Sisig queen.

The US military bases located in the town might have played a role in the invention of this dish. People can buy cheap
 pig heads in commissaries because these are not normally consumed inside the base. Meat from the pig heads are scraped
 out, boiled, grilled, and made into what is now known as Sisig</p></font>
